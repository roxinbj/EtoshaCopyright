Bat-eared foxes usually forage in groups. Prey is located by hearing, rather than by sight or smell. Their foraging times usually coincide with termite availability and activity. For instance, in summer they begin foraging at sunset, whereas in winter they forage earlier in the day. The bat-eared fox relies on its speed, hearing and dodging ability to escape predators. Staying in large groups also increases the chance of spotting a predator in good time. The species name ‘megalotis’ comes from the Greek words ‘mega’ and ‘otus’ meaning ‘large eared’. The large ears of the bat-eared fox can be up to 14cm long and provide it with excellent hearing. They are also full of blood vessels that release heat and keep the fox cool.
